    <h2>Italian Gelato</h2>
    <p>Gelato made with cream, milk, egg yolks, and sugar. This basic recipe is from my Italian mother-in-law and is perfect to use as a base for your favorite flavors. Try adding vanilla, shaved chocolate, or your favorite fruits. They're all delicious!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of milk</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix milk and cream in a medium saucepan. Warm until foam forms around the edges. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Beat egg yolks and sugar until frothy in a large bowl. Gradually pour warm milk into egg yolks and sugar, whisking constantly. Return mixture to saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until the mixture gels slightly and coats the back of the spoon. If small egg lumps begin to show, remove from heat immediately.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture through a sieve or fine strainer into a bowl. Cover, and chill for 2 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to a sealed container, and freeze until firm, at least 2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
