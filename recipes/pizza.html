    <h2>Pepperoni Pizza Dough</h2>
    <p>This is an amazing recipe for the perfect pizza dough. While this recipe is primarly focused on pepperoni pizza, it will work for any style you choose!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup warm water (110 to 115 degrees)</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast or 1 3/4 teaspoons instant (fresh) yeast</li>
        <li>3 1/4 cups bread flour or unbleached all puspose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus 1 tablespoon for brushing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the warm water in a small bowl and sprinkle with the yeast. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 5 minutes or until foamy. Stir to dissolve, if necessary.</li>
        <li>In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and salt and mix briefly to combine. Turn the mixer on low speed, add the yeast mixture and mix to combine. Add the water and 3 tablespoons of olive oil and knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Alternatively, you can knead the dough by hand on a floured surface for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into a smooth ball, place it on a floured surface and cover with an inverted bowl, plastic wrap or a damp cloth. Let rise at room temperature for about 1½ hours, or until doubled in bulk.</li>
        <li>About 30 minutes before baking the pizza, place a pizza stone on the lowest rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 500°F.</li>
        <li>When the dough is ready, use a large knife or a bench scraper to divide it into 4 equal pieces. With lightly floured hands, press out any bubbles that might have formed in the dough and form each piece into a small smooth ball. Place about 4 inches apart on a lightly floured surface and, when your grill is preheated and ready to go, roll out the dough and add toppings on the grill.</li>
    </ol>
